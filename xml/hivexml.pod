=head1 NAME

hivexml - Convert Windows Registry binary "hive" into XML

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 hivexml [-dk] hivefile > output.xml

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This program converts a single Windows Registry binary "hive"
file into a self-describing XML format.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item B<-d>

Enable lots of debug messages.  If you find a Registry file
that this program cannot parse, please enable this option and
post the complete output I<and> the Registry file in your
bug report.

=item B<-k>

Keep going even if we find errors in the Registry file.  This
skips over any parts of the Registry that we cannot read.

=item B<-u>

Use heuristics to tolerate certain levels of corruption within hives.

This is unsafe but may allow to export/merge valid keys/values in an
otherwise corrupted hive.
